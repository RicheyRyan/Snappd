This is Snappd, a camera application for Android Gingerbread 2.3.3.

## Goal

The purpose of this application was to create a camera application for Android phones with many features and that scaled across different screen sizes well.

It was also an opportunity to learn about programming for Android and with the camera APIs in particular. It was a colloborative project between myself and a fellow student Shane. I handled the majority of the programming while Shane designed the UI and created the graphical assets for the app.

## Functionality

There are several options that could be adjusted with the app:
-   White Balance
-Focus Setting
-Colour Mode
-Image Quality
-Scene Settings (Party, Night, Beach etc.)
-Zoom
-Resolution
-Flash

Certain editing features were also included such as:
-Cropping
-Rotation
-Undo/Redo

It was intended to allow for sharing functionality but this feature doesn't not work properly. Additionally, due to the fact that the app allows for very high quality images to be captured, the image editing functionality can lead the app to crash due to limited memory being available.
